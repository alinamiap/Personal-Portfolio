									<h2><a href="https://www.uhd.edu/">Pet Finder</a></h2>
										<p>"Pet Finder" is a user-friendly website designed to assist individuals in finding the perfect companion animal based on their lifestyle. The website offers a unique feature: a personalized quiz that users can take to determine the most suitable pets for their specific needs and preferences.</p>
						
									<h2><a href="https://github.com/joshb88/CS3321GroupProject">Hospital Management</a></h2>
										<p>"Hospital Management" is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline the operations of a healthcare facility, offering distinct functionalities for both patients and staff. The system is accessed through secure logins, ensuring privacy and data protection.</p>
										<p>For patients, the software provides a user-friendly portal where they can log in to access personalized information. Patients can view their medical history, upcoming procedures, and appointment schedules. Additionally, the platform displays detailed billing information, including any outstanding bills and upcoming payment due dates. This empowers patients to stay informed about their healthcare journey and manage financial aspects efficiently.</p>
										<p>On the staff side, the software offers a range of features to enhance operational efficiency. Staff members can view the availability of rooms, helping in efficient patient allocation. They can also modify inventory levels, ensuring that necessary medical supplies are adequately stocked. To replenish supplies, staff can place orders directly through the system.</p>
										<p>Furthermore, the software enables staff to manage patient orders and procedures seamlessly. This includes scheduling medical procedures, updating patient records, and coordinating with other departments for integrated healthcare delivery. The system contributes to effective communication and collaboration among healthcare professionals.</p>
										
									<h2><a href="https://morbidmia.itch.io/delivery-driver">Delivery Driver</a></h2>
										<p>"Delivery Driver" is an engaging and strategic minigame that puts players in the driver's seat of a delivery vehicle on a mission to collect and deliver packages. Developed with the help of a Udemy course in game development, the game introduces fundamental concepts like scripts, objects, audio, and scenes. The objective is simple yet challenging: players must navigate through the game world, picking up one package at a time and delivering it to its destination. The visual cue of the vehicle changing color upon package pickup adds an interesting twist, and players must be wary of crashes, which significantly slow down the vehicle. With speed boosts strategically placed to aid in delivery efficiency, "Delivery Driver" offers a fun and immersive gaming experience. </p>

									<h2><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uaCn70TCs1e2vvG_yj3e1gEcWfB0RxOn?usp=sharing">Motion-Activated Plant Hydration System</a></h2>
										<p>The motion-activated plant hydration system we're exploring represents a blend of modern technology and caring for plants. It lets users place their plants on a sleek platform and start watering them with a simple hand motion near the special ultrasonic sensor. This sensor can sense objects within 20 centimeters.</p>
										<p>When an object is detected within this range, the system springs into action. It turns on a strip of LED lights that illuminate the platform, creating a visually pleasing effect. Simultaneously, a quiet water pump activates, transporting water from a hidden reservoir through a concealed pipe to nourish the plant's roots.</p>
										<p>The system is smartly designed to interpret distances using the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE). This allows it to react only when an object is close enough. Think of it like a digital conductor coordinating the whole process.</p>
