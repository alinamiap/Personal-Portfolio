									<h2><a href="https://abjj1999.github.io/pets/">Pet Finder</a></h2>
										<p>The "Pet Finder" webpage, developed by a dynamic team of four individuals, presents an innovative approach to connecting users with their ideal canine companions. This interactive platform centers around a customized quiz designed to align users with dogs that suit their lifestyle. As part of this collaborative effort, my specific role involved crafting the "About Us" page, which serves as a virtual introduction to the creators behind the project.</p>
										<p>Utilizing a blend of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I implemented an engaging slideshow on the "About Us" page to showcase each contributor. The slideshow dynamically displays images and brief explanations of the team members. Within the brief descriptions of each contributor, users can learn about the unique skills and perspectives that each team member brings to the project. To further enhance the user's understanding of the team's capabilities, I incorporated links to individual resumes, portfolios, LinkedIn profiles, and GitHub repositories.</p>

									<h2><a href="https://github.com/joshb88/CS3321GroupProject">Hospital Management</a></h2>
										<p>The collaborative team project I recently completed involved the development of a hospital management software using an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm. This semester-long initiative aimed at enhancing our understanding of Software Engineering, fostering collaboration through GitHub, and honing our coding skills.</p>
										<p>The software provides a user-friendly interface for both patients and staff, offering distinct menus upon sign-in. Users can create and update accounts, while patients can view bills, and staff can access inventory and schedules. The primary objective of the project was to introduce a novel approach to navigating the healthcare system.</p>
										<p>My specific contributions to the project included the creation of several boundary classes, such as viewBill, viewRoomAvailabilityReport, viewSchedule, and inventoryOrders. Additionally, I designed the staff interface menu, authored comprehensive user documentation encompassing installation and usage guidelines, and formulated 28 test cases. My role extended to executing these test cases and documenting the corresponding results, ensuring the reliability and functionality of the developed software. This project has not only enhanced our technical skills but has also provided valuable insights into collaborative software development practices and effective use of version control systems like GitHub.</p>
										
									<h2><a href="https://morbidmia.itch.io/delivery-driver">Delivery Driver</a></h2>
										<p>"Delivery Driver" is an engaging and strategic minigame that puts players in the driver's seat of a delivery vehicle on a mission to collect and deliver packages. Developed with the help of a Udemy course in game development, the game introduces fundamental concepts like scripts, objects, audio, and scenes. The objective is simple yet challenging: players must navigate through the game world, picking up one package at a time and delivering it to its destination. The visual cue of the vehicle changing color upon package pickup adds an interesting twist, and players must be wary of crashes, which significantly slow down the vehicle. With speed boosts strategically placed to aid in delivery efficiency, "Delivery Driver" offers a fun and immersive gaming experience. </p>

									<h2><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uaCn70TCs1e2vvG_yj3e1gEcWfB0RxOn?usp=sharing">Motion-Activated Plant Hydration System</a></h2>
									<p>Innovating the intersection of technology and plant care, our motion-activated plant hydration system merges sleek design with functionality. Users can effortlessly water their plants through a hand motion near the ultrasonic sensor, triggering LED lights for ambiance and a quiet water pump to nourish roots from a concealed reservoir.</p>
									<p>Using the Arduino IDE, our system intelligently gauges distances, ensuring a seamless and responsive experience. Think of it as a digital conductor orchestrating the entire process, making plant care both accessible and delightful.</p>
									<p>My specific contribution focused on programming and wiring the water pump with the Arduino Uno. Initially facing challenges with crowding on the board, I identified the need for a relay to handle higher power requirements. After resolving this issue, I successfully integrated the LED strip programming, ensuring both components worked harmoniously, contributing to the overall functionality and elegance of the system.</p>
